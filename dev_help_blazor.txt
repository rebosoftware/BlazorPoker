***so blazor client is still in preview mode
***run this
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates::3.0.0-preview9.19465.2

**then you can use the template
dotnet new blazorwasm -n BPClient

To run the app from the CLI. I cd into the project directory and run:

dotnet run

then open this in chrome http://localhost:5000/


Now I can load the app in a browser and edit and test my code changes.
 I even noticed that "hot reload" works.

I opened an issue with Microsoft Visual Studio Feedback System. A senior product manager 
replied 4 days ago with this message: "We have started working on adding support for Blazor Web Assembly."
